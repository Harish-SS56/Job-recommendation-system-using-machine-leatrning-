Job Recommendation System

This project is a Streamlit-based Job Recommendation System designed to assist both job seekers and recruiters in simplifying the hiring process. Leveraging NLP techniques, TF-IDF similarity, and real-time job APIs, this application provides tailored recommendations and insights.

 Features

Job Seeker Module
- Upload CVs: Users can upload multiple CVs in PDF format, which are parsed to extract relevant text and skills using NLP.
- Skill Extraction: Identifies key skills and keywords from the uploaded CVs using **SpaCy** NLP.
- Job Recommendations:
  - From a local dataset of job listings using TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity.
  - Real-time job openings fetched via the Jooble API based on extracted skills.
- Interactive CV Display: CVs are displayed in an embedded PDF viewer, with an option to download them.

Recruiter Module
- Job Description Analysis: Recruiters can input a job description, which is processed to extract key features.
- CV Matching: Matches uploaded CVs to the job description using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and ranks them based on similarity scores.
- Top Recommendations: Displays top-matching CVs with their similarity scores and allows recruiters to view, download, or save the results.
- Downloadable Reports: Export similarity scores and rankings as a text file.

Core Technologies
- Streamlit: For building an interactive and user-friendly web application.
- NLP Tools:
  - SpaCy: Skill extraction from CVs and job descriptions.
  - NLTK: Text preprocessing, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- TF-IDF Vectorization: To compute similarity between job descriptions and CVs.
- Cosine Similarity: For ranking CV-job matches.
- Jooble API Integration: For real-time job recommendations.
- PyMuPDF (Fitz): For extracting text from PDF files.
- Pandas: For managing and analyzing job and CV data.
